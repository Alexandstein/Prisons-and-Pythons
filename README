===PRISONS AND PYTHONS===
	This is just a little Dungeons and Dragons character manager I decided to start 
writing one day. Not necessarily strictly DnD though-- if I make good headway with this 
I will probably make it extensible.
	At the moment, I'm trying to design the abstract character class to be extensible to
most RPG character needs so that people may subclass it for their own needs.
Ideally subclassing might not be needed and template files can be used to construct
RPG character bases.
